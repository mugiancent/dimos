"""Go2 SmartNav blueprint: PGO + VoxelMapper + CostMapper + ReplanningAStarPlanner.

Uses PGO for loop-closure-corrected odometry. VoxelMapper (with column carving)
builds the global_map for CostMapper so that stale obstacles are cleared when the
robot rescans an area — PGO's accumulated global_static_map is kept for
visualisation only (remapped to pgo_global_static_map).

PGO accepts PoseStamped input directly and outputs both corrected Odometry and
PoseStamped.

Data flow:
    GO2Connection.lidar (remapped → registered_scan) → PGO  (for pose correction)
    GO2Connection.lidar (remapped → registered_scan) → VoxelGridMapper  (for navigation map)
    GO2Connection.odom  (remapped → raw_odom)         → PGO
    PGO.corrected_odometry (Odometry)
    PGO.odom (PoseStamped) → ReplanningAStarPlanner
    VoxelGridMapper.global_map → CostMapper → ReplanningAStarPlanner
    ReplanningAStarPlanner.cmd_vel → GO2Connection
