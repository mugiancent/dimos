Dask worker preload script: preloads PyTorch shared libraries before the TLS
block fills up.

On Linux (aarch64 in particular), PyTorch's libc10.so uses static TLS storage.
If it is loaded lazily via dlopen() inside a spawned/forked worker process after
other libraries have already consumed the TLS block, the linker raises:

    cannot allocate memory in static TLS block

Registering this module as a Dask worker preload (via LocalCluster worker_kwargs)
ensures the libraries are loaded at worker startup — before any user code runs —
giving them first access to the TLS slots they need.
