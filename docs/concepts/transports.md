# Intro

Transports enable communication between [modules](modules.md) across process boundaries and networks.

Each line in this example graph is a Transport, each node is a Module.

![output](assets/go2_agentic.svg)

Each of these lines can be a different Transport (protocol) that modules use to communicate with each other.

Module transports are always unidirectional (they have a broadcaster and receiver side)

Implementation wise these are things like HTTP server, redis, ROS DDS etc. Generally for most deployments we use the same pubsub protocol, usually LCM or shared memory.

Modules internally don't know or care how their data is transported. They just emit messages and subscribe to messages. It is a job of a transport to reliably deliver those messages.

Messages can be anything a transport can transport, so binary data, images, pointclouds etc. Most of the time these are `dimos.msgs`

# Using Transports with Blueprints

See [Blueprints](blueprints.md) for more on blueprints API

From [`unitree_go2_blueprints.py`](/dimos/robot/unitree_webrtc/unitree_go2_blueprints.py)
Here is an example of rebinding some topics used for Unitree GO2 to `ROSTransport` (defined at [`transport.py`](/dimos/core/transport.py#L226)) from the default `LCMTransport`

This allows us to view the data with rviz2

```python skip
nav = autoconnect(
    basic,
    voxel_mapper(voxel_size=0.1),
    cost_mapper(),
    replanning_a_star_planner(),
    wavefront_frontier_explorer(),
).global_config(n_dask_workers=6, robot_model="unitree_go2")

ros = nav.transports(
    {
        ("lidar", PointCloud2): ROSTransport("lidar", PointCloud2),
        ("global_map", PointCloud2): ROSTransport("global_map", PointCloud2),
        ("odom", PoseStamped): ROSTransport("odom", PoseStamped),
        ("color_image", Image): ROSTransport("color_image", Image),
    }
)
```

# Using Transports with Modules

Every module stream can use a different transport. Set `.transport` on the stream before starting the module:

```python ansi=false
import time

from dimos.core import In, Module, start
from dimos.core.transport import LCMTransport
from dimos.hardware.sensors.camera.module import CameraModule
from dimos.msgs.sensor_msgs import Image


# Define a simple listener module
class ImageListener(Module):
    image: In[Image]

    def start(self):
        super().start()
        self.image.subscribe(lambda img: print(f"Received: {img.shape}"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start cluster and deploy modules to separate processes
    dimos = start(2)

    camera = dimos.deploy(CameraModule, frequency=2.0)
    listener = dimos.deploy(ImageListener)

    # Connect via shared memory transport (pSHMTransport uses pickle encoding)
    camera.color_image.transport = LCMTransport("/camera/rgb", Image)
    listener.image.connect(camera.color_image)

    # Or we can set manually, these are equivalent.
    # Setting manually allows us to implement and run listener in a separate file
    #
    # listener.image.transport = LCMTransport("/camera/rgb", Image)

    # Start both modules
    camera.start()
    listener.start()

    time.sleep(2)

    dimos.stop()
```

<!--Result:-->
```

# Inspecting LCM traffic (CLI)

`lcmspy` shows topic frequency/bandwidth stats.

![lcmspy](assets/lcmspy.png)

`dimos topic echo /topic` listens on typed channels like `/topic#pkg.Msg` and decodes automatically.

```sh

Image(shape=(480, 640, 3), format=RGB, dtype=uint8, dev=cpu, ts=2026-01-24 20:28:59)

```

# Theory

Transport is implemented by subclassing `Transport` at [`core/stream.py`](/dimos/core/stream.py#L83) and implementing `broadcast` and `subscribe` functions.

Your init arguments to Transport can be anything you'd like - an IP address and port, a shared memory segment name, a file path, or a Redis channel,

The way you transfer and encode the data is an implementation detail left to you. You can specify which type of data you are able to transport on a type level.

For example Video encoding HTTP transport probaby only takes Image type. TCP channel takes bytes etc.

Rebinding an existing go2 blueprint to use (imagined) TCP transport for lidar (each module that requires lidar data would connect via TCP to this ip) would look something like this:


```python skip
from dimos.robot.unitree_webrtc.unitree_go2_blueprints import nav

# use TCP for lidar data (each module individually would establish a tcp connection)
ros = nav.transports(
   {("lidar", PointCloud2): TCPTransport(ip="10.10.10.1",port=1414)}
)
```

subscribe() of your TCP transport needs to return a standard `PointCloud2` object in the case above, we don't care how you transport, encode or construct it,

If helpful, all our types provide `lcm_encode` and `lcm_decode` functions for (faster then pickle and language agnostic) binary encoding. for more info on this, check [lcm](/docs/concepts/lcm.md)

# Practice (PubSub Transports)

For now at dimos, we've been using exclusively PubSub protocols for our transports.

`PubSub` abstract class is what those protocols implement, it's just `publish(topic, message)` and `subscribe(topic, callback)` functions

```python session=pubsub_demo ansi=false
from dimos.protocol.pubsub.spec import PubSub

# The interface every transport must implement:
import inspect
print(inspect.getsource(PubSub.publish))
print(inspect.getsource(PubSub.subscribe))
```

<!--Result:-->
```python
    @abstractmethod
    def publish(self, topic: TopicT, message: MsgT) -> None:
        """Publish a message to a topic."""
        ...

    @abstractmethod
    def subscribe(
        self, topic: TopicT, callback: Callable[[MsgT, TopicT], None]
    ) -> Callable[[], None]:
        """Subscribe to a topic with a callback. returns unsubscribe function"""
        ...
```

So new protocols are very easy to implement.

We don't tell you what topic type actually is, it can be a complex configuration object, and we also don't tell you what a message is. it can be bytes, json etc. Generally most of our transports we have are made to transport specifically our ros compatible message types (see [LCM](/docs/concepts/lcm.md))

But we also have generic pickle transports that will send off any python object

# Using Transports Directly

We could easily instantiate and pass messages using a pubsub implementation, though normally you would not do this, and would use module or blueprint level API.

## LCM

LCM is UDP multicast, will work through fast reliable networks on a robot.

```python session=lcm_demo ansi=false
from dimos.protocol.pubsub.lcmpubsub import LCM, Topic
from dimos.msgs.geometry_msgs import Vector3

lcm = LCM(autoconf=True)
lcm.start()

received = []
topic = Topic(topic="/robot/velocity", Vector3)

lcm.subscribe(topic, lambda msg, t: received.append(msg))
lcm.publish(topic, Vector3(1.0, 0.0, 0.5))

import time
time.sleep(0.1)

print(f"Received velocity: x={received[0].x}, y={received[0].y}, z={received[0].z}")
lcm.stop()
```

<!--Result:-->
```
Received velocity: x=1.0, y=0.0, z=0.5
```

## Shared Memory

Shared Memory is highest performancce, works only on the same machien as IPC

```python session=shm_demo ansi=false
from dimos.protocol.pubsub.shmpubsub import PickleSharedMemory

shm = PickleSharedMemory(prefer="cpu")
shm.start()

received = []
shm.subscribe("test/topic", lambda msg, topic: received.append(msg))
shm.publish("test/topic", {"data": [1, 2, 3]})

import time
time.sleep(0.1)  # Allow message to propagate

print(f"Received: {received}")
shm.stop()
```

<!--Result:-->
```
Received: [{'data': [1, 2, 3]}]
```

# Implementing a Simple Transport

The simplest toy transport is `Memory`, which works within a single process, start from there,

```python session=memory_demo ansi=false
from dimos.protocol.pubsub.memory import Memory

# Create a memory transport
bus = Memory()

# Track received messages
received = []

# Subscribe to a topic
unsubscribe = bus.subscribe("sensor/data", lambda msg, topic: received.append(msg))

# Publish messages
bus.publish("sensor/data", {"temperature": 22.5})
bus.publish("sensor/data", {"temperature": 23.0})

print(f"Received {len(received)} messages:")
for msg in received:
    print(f"  {msg}")

# Unsubscribe when done
unsubscribe()
```

<!--Result:-->
```
Received 2 messages:
  {'temperature': 22.5}
  {'temperature': 23.0}
```

The full implementation is minimal. See [`memory.py`](/dimos/protocol/pubsub/memory.py) for the complete source.

# Encode/Decode Mixins

Transports often need to serialize messages before sending and deserialize after receiving. The `PubSubEncoderMixin` at [`pubsub/spec.py`](/dimos/protocol/pubsub/spec.py#L95) provides a clean way to add encoding/decoding to any pubsub implementation.

## Available Mixins

| Mixin                          | Encoding        | Use Case                              |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| `PickleEncoderMixin`           | Python pickle   | Any Python object, same-language only |
| `LCMEncoderMixin`              | LCM binary      | Cross-language (C/C++/Python/Java/Go) |
| `JpegEncoderMixin`             | JPEG compressed | Image data, reduces bandwidth         |

The `LCMEncoderMixin` is especially powerful because LCM messages encode to compact binary that works across languages. This means you can use LCM message definitions with *any* transport - not just LCM's UDP multicast. See [lcm](/docs/concepts/lcm.md) for details on LCM message types.

## Creating a Custom Mixin

Subclass `PubSubEncoderMixin` and implement `encode()` and `decode()`:

```python session=jsonencoder
from dimos.protocol.pubsub.spec import PubSubEncoderMixin
import json

class JsonEncoderMixin(PubSubEncoderMixin[str, dict, bytes]):
    def encode(self, msg: dict, topic: str) -> bytes:
        return json.dumps(msg).encode('utf-8')

    def decode(self, msg: bytes, topic: str) -> dict:
        return json.loads(msg.decode('utf-8'))
```

Then combine with a pubsub implementation using multiple inheritance:

```python session=jsonencoder
from dimos.protocol.pubsub import Memory

class MyJsonPubSub(JsonEncoderMixin, Memory):
    pass
```

The mixin automatically wraps `publish()` and `subscribe()` to handle encoding/decoding transparently. Your new transport implementation stays the same - just swap the mixin:

```python session=jsonencoder
from dimos.protocol.pubsub.spec import PickleEncoderMixin

# Switch to pickle - just change the mixin
class MyPicklePubSub(PickleEncoderMixin, Memory):
    pass
```

Same transport, different serialization - no code changes needed in the transport itself.

# Passing tests

## Spec

check [`pubsub/test_spec.py`](/dimos/protocol/pubsub/test_spec.py) for grid tests for your new protocol, make sure to pass those spec tests

## Benchmarks

We also have fancy benchmark tests that will tell you your max bandwidth, latency, message throughput etc.

`python -m pytest -svm tool -k "not bytes" dimos/protocol/pubsub/benchmark/test_benchmark.py`
